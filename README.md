# Political Statistics Final Project â€“ Spring 2022
This project was assigned in POL90 at Pomona College in the Spring of 2022 as a capstone project, measuring students' understanding of statistics as it was taught throughout the semester. Students were allowed to research any issue of their choosen given four different datasets from surveys conducted by the American National Election Studies, a collaboration between Stanford University and the University of Michigan. For my report, I chose to explore the reelationship between watching crime dramas and public opinion of police.
